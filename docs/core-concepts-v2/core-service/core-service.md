# Introduction
Everyone in Web3 talks about giving back ownership to users in Web3, but what we can do to really achieve that? Our approach is giving you a user-friendly way to let you self-host all the services by yourself. Thanks to the development of Docker and other containerization tools, makes it possible for us to host the service and keep the data locally and avoid depending on any third party.
In `Core Service`, there will be a dashboard that functions as CoreService Store to help to deploy the other services you may need. 

# How it works
We will package all the services to docker images, and provide the docker-compose.yaml file to run the CoreService. 
After running the CoreService, there will be dashboard that can help to deploy the services you might need to self-host, e.g.: ProofService, RelationService.
