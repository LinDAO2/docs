In addition to the changelogs available on the previous page, we also offer SDK release notes to keep you informed about updates to each SDK we support. Our goal is to provide you with a seamless experience when upgrading your SDK, and we want to ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of how our SDKs are evolving.

At present, **[Next.ID](http://next.id/)** offers three SDKs for your development convenience:

- JavaScript SDK - [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/NextDotID/sdk)
- Rust SDK - [GitHub Repository link](https://github.com/NextDotID/sdk_rust)
- Java SDK - [GitHub  Repository Link](https://github.com/NextDotID/sdk_java)

If your preferred programming language doesn't have a corresponding SDK, you can use our standard REST API as an alternative. We are open to expanding our SDK offerings based on developer demand. If you'd like to see support for a specific programming language, please don't hesitate to request it by emailing us at **[developer@next.id](mailto:developer@next.id)**.
