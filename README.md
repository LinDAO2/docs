# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a
modern static website generator.

### Installation

```sh
$ pnpm
```

### Local Development

```sh
$ pnpm start
```

Or

```sh
$ just start zh-Hans
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser
window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the
server.

### Build

```
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and
can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

> Auto deployed by Github Actions.
